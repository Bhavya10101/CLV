# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric used to estimate the long-term value of consumers. Accurate CLV prediction is critical in e-commerce, enabling businesses to optimize marketing expenditures, identify high-value customers, and reduce the risk of loss due to customer churn.

In recent years, CLV has become increasingly important in mobile advertising, where understanding user value can improve ad targeting and campaign effectiveness. By analyzing consumer behavior and aligning it with strategic marketing plans under budget constraints, businesses can identify a segment of high-potential customers. Personalized marketing efforts, delivered at the right time and context, serve as the final step in maximizing user engagement and retention.

This project proposes a machine learning model for CLV prediction, built using an ensemble of **XGBoost** and **K-Means clustering**. The model ranks customers by their probability of making future purchases under varying conditions. It also incorporates a wide array of features to forecast value, predict churn, and assess customer loyalty.

## Key Components

- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporates demographic data, historical purchase patterns, website interactions, and sentiment analysis from social media to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes an ensemble learning approach combining XGBoost for regression and K-Means for customer segmentation.
- **Ranking**: Customers are ranked based on their predicted purchasing behavior and value under different conditions.

## Challenges Addressed

### 1. Algorithm Design
Designing an effective algorithm requires careful selection of features and modeling techniques. Incorporating diverse behavioral and contextual features significantly improves predictive performance. Future enhancements may involve integrating deep learning architectures or reinforcement learning to refine prediction capabilities.

### 2. Performance Evaluation
While standard metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** help evaluate prediction accuracy, they may not capture the complete picture. Developing new evaluation metrics that incorporate long-term profitability and customer retention provides deeper insights into model effectiveness.

### 3. System Deployment
Deploying CLV prediction systems in real-world e-commerce platforms presents operational challenges. These include:
- Seamless integration with existing infrastructure
- Scalability to handle large volumes of data
- Real-time prediction capabilities
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)

## Future Scope
- Integration of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU) for sequence-based behavioral data
- Real-time dashboards to monitor customer value trajectories
- A/B testing frameworks to validate marketing interventions
